\begin{acknowledgment}
ASME Technical Publications provided the format specifications for the Journal of Mechanical Design, though they are not easy to reproduce.  It is their commitment to ensuring quality figures in every issue of JMD that motivates this effort to have authors review the presentation of their figures.

Thanks go to D. E. Knuth and L. Lamport for developing the wonderful word processing software packages \TeX\ and \LaTeX. We would like to thank Ken Sprott, Kirk van Katwyk, and Matt Campbell for fixing bugs in the ASME style file \verb+asme2ej.cls+, and Geoff Shiflett for creating
ASME bibliography stype file \verb+asmems4.bst+.

% The bibliography is stored in an external database file
% in the BibTeX format (file_name.bib).  The bibliography is
% created by the following command and it will appear in this
% position in the document. You may, of course, create your
% own bibliography by using thebibliography environment as in
%
% \begin{thebibliography}{12}
% ...
% \bibitem{itemreference} D. E. Knudsen.
% {\em 1966 World Bnus Almanac.}
% {Permafrost Press, Novosibirsk.}
% ...
% \end{thebibliography}

% Here's where you specify the bibliography style file.
% The full file name for the bibliography style file
% used for an ASME paper is asmems4.bst.
\bibliographystyle{asmems4}

% Here's where you specify the bibliography database file.
% The full file name of the bibliography database for this
% article is asme2e.bib. The name for your database is up

\section*{Appendix B: Head of Second Appendix}
\subsection*{Subsection head in appendix}
The equation counter is not reset in an appendix and the numbers will
follow one continual sequence from the beginning of the article to the very end as shown in the following example.
\begin{equation}
a = b + c.
